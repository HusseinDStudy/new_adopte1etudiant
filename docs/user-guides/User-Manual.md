### a. Complete Your Profile

A complete profile is key to attracting companies.

*   **Offer List (`/offers`)**: This is the main page for browsing all available offers. You can use the search bar to filter offers by title, description, or company name.
*   **Match Score**: When you are logged in, each offer will display a `matchScore`. This score is calculated based on how well the skills required for the offer match the skills on your profile. Offers are sorted with the highest match score first, helping you see the most relevant opportunities at a glance.
*   **Applying**: Click on an offer to see the details. If you are interested, click the "Apply" button. Your application will be sent to the company.
