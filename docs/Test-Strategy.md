# Test Strategy

## Executive Summary

The AdopteUnEtudiant project implements a comprehensive testing strategy designed to ensure high code quality, prevent regressions, and enable confident deployment. Our testing approach has achieved:

- **302 automated tests** covering all critical functionality
- **89.21% statement coverage** and **81.67% branch coverage**
- **100% function coverage** across all modules
- **Zero tolerance for failing tests** in main branch

## Testing Philosophy

### Quality First Approach
We believe that **quality is everyone's responsibility** and that automated testing is essential for:
- **Rapid development cycles** with confidence
- **Regression prevention** during refactoring
- **Documentation** of expected behavior
- **Improved code design** through testability requirements

### Pyramid Strategy
Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid principle:

```
                    /\
                   /  \
                  / E2E \
                 /______\
                /        \
               /Integration\
              /__________\
             /            \
            /     Unit      \
           /________________\
```

1. **Unit Tests (Foundation)**: Fast, isolated tests for business logic
2. **Integration Tests (Majority)**: API endpoint testing with database
3. **End-to-End Tests (Selective)**: Critical user workflows

## Test Coverage Strategy

### Coverage Targets

| Metric | Minimum | Target | Current |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Statement Coverage | 70% | 85% | **89.21%** ✅ |
| Branch Coverage | 65% | 80% | **81.67%** ✅ |
| Function Coverage | 80% | 95% | **100%** ✅ |
| Line Coverage | 70% | 85% | **89.21%** ✅ |

### Coverage Priorities

1. **Critical Business Logic** (Required: 95%+)
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Payment processing
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Security-related functionality

2. **Core Features** (Required: 85%+)
   - User management
   - Job applications
   - Adoption requests
   - Messaging system

3. **Supporting Features** (Target: 75%+)
   - Profile management
   - Search functionality
   - Notifications

## Testing Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
For critical features, we follow the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
For user-facing features, we write tests that describe **business behavior**:
```typescript
describe('User authentication', () => {
  it('should allow valid users to log in', () => {
    // Given a registered user
    // When they provide correct credentials
    // Then they should be authenticated
  });
});
```

### Risk-Based Testing
We prioritize testing based on:
- **Business impact** of failure
- **Complexity** of the code
- **Frequency** of changes
- **Security implications**

## Test Types and Responsibilities

### Unit Tests
**Purpose**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
**Scope**: Business logic, utilities, pure functions
**Tools**: Vitest, Jest mocks
**Examples**:
- Password validation logic
- Data transformation functions
- Business rule calculations

### Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Test component interaction with real dependencies
**Scope**: API endpoints, database operations, external services
**Tools**: Vitest + Supertest + Test Database
**Examples**:
- POST /api/auth/register with database
- File upload processing
- Email service integration

### End-to-End Tests
**Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
**Scope**: Critical business processes from UI to database
**Tools**: Planned (Playwright/Cypress)
**Examples**:
- Complete user registration flow
- Job application submission
- Payment processing

### Security Tests
**Purpose**: Verify security controls and vulnerability resistance
**Scope**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
**Tools**: Custom security test suite
**Examples**:
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS protection
- CSRF token validation

### Performance Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure system performance under load
**Scope**: API response times, database queries, concurrent users
**Tools**: Custom load testing framework
**Examples**:
- 100 concurrent user simulation
- Database query optimization validation
- Memory leak detection

## Test Environment Strategy

### Environment Isolation
We maintain **strict separation** between environments:

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Database |
|-------------|---------|------|----------|
| **Test** | Automated testing | Synthetic | Isolated test DB |
| **Development** | Developer testing | Synthetic | Local dev DB |
| **Staging** | Manual QA | Production-like | Staging DB |
| **Production** | Live system | Real user data | Production DB |

### Test Data Management
- **Synthetic data** generated using Faker.js
- **Database isolation** with automatic cleanup
- **No production data** in test environments
- **Consistent test scenarios** across all tests

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Checks
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage thresholds must be met
- Linting and formatting checks
- Type checking (TypeScript)

### Pull Request Requirements
- New features must include tests
- Coverage cannot decrease below thresholds
- All existing tests must pass
- Security tests must pass

### Deployment Criteria
- **100% test pass rate** required
- Coverage thresholds maintained
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security scan passed

## Testing Tools and Infrastructure
