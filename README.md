## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Development

This is the recommended way to run the project locally. You will run the database in a Docker container and the application services directly on your host machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Initialize Environment Variables**
    This command copies the example `.env` files for you.
    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

3.  **Configure Your Environment**
    Manually edit the following files and fill in the required values (database credentials, OAuth keys, etc.):
    - `.env`
    - `apps/api/.env`
    - `apps/web/.env`

### Launching the Application

1.  **Start the database:**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up -d
    ```

2.  **Run the applications:**
    This command will start both the API and Web services concurrently.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Alternatively, to see logs for each service in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    # In terminal 1
    npm run dev --workspace=apps/api

    # In terminal 2
    npm run dev --workspace=apps/web
    ```

- **Access the application:**
  - **Web App**: `http://localhost:5173`
  - **API**: `http://localhost:8080`
  - **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8080/docs` (Interactive Swagger UI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Other Ways to Run the Project

### Production Environment

The production environment runs using pre-built Docker images.

1.  **Build Production Images:**
    The production `Dockerfile` is multi-stage and can build targeted images.
    ```bash
    # Build the API image
    docker build -t your-registry/api:latest --target api .

    # Build the Web image
    docker build -t your-registry/web:latest --target web .
    ```

2.  **Push Images to a Registry (Optional, but recommended):**
    ```bash
    docker push your-registry/api:latest
    docker push your-registry/web:latest
    ```

3.  **Launch from Production Compose File:**
    Make sure you have a `.env` file configured for your production environment.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
    ```

### Testing

- **Run all tests (Unit, Integration, etc.):**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **E2E and Stress Tests:**
  The project contains End-to-End tests in `apps/api/src/__tests__/e2e-workflows.test.ts` and stress tests. These are run as part of the `npm test` command and require a running database connection.
