# AdopteUnEtudiant

**Connecting the next generation of talent with future-forward companies in France.**

AdopteUnEtudiant is a modern web platform designed to bridge the gap between students seeking valuable work experience and companies looking for bright, emerging talent. Our mission is to simplify the search for internships and work-study programs (`alternance`), making it easier for students and companies to find the perfect match.
